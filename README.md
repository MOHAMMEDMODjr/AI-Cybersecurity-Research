## Introduction

As organizations increasingly adopt AI technologies, understanding their implications for cybersecurity becomes crucial. This repository aims to shed light on the challenges and opportunities presented by AI and LLMs. By exploring established frameworks like NIST AI RMF, OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, and MITRE ATLAS, we provide a structured approach to managing risks associated with AI in cybersecurity.

## Project Overview

This repository includes:

- A detailed white paper that outlines the risks and benefits of using AI in cybersecurity.
- A presentation that summarizes the key findings and recommendations.
- Relevant frameworks and guidelines for implementing AI safely and effectively.

The project serves as a resource for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and anyone interested in the evolving landscape of AI and security.

## Key Topics

Our research covers several important topics in the realm of AI and cybersecurity:

- **AI Security**: Understanding the security implications of AI technologies.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Exploring the role of AI in modern cybersecurity.
- **Cyber Threat Intelligence**: Utilizing AI for threat detection and response.
- **Cybersecurity**: General practices and frameworks for securing digital assets.
- **Data Poisoning**: Risks associated with training data and its impact on AI models.
- **Large Language Models**: Specific vulnerabilities and challenges posed by LLMs.
- **LLM Vulnerabilities**: Identifying and mitigating risks unique to LLMs.
- **MITRE ATLAS**: Using the MITRE framework to assess AI security.
- **NIST AI RMF**: Implementing the NIST framework for managing AI risks.
- **OWASP**: Guidelines for securing AI applications.
- **Prompt Injection**: Understanding and mitigating risks associated with user input in AI systems.

## Mitigation Frameworks

To effectively manage the risks associated with AI and LLMs, we discuss several frameworks:

### NIST AI RMF

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) provides guidelines for managing risks related to AI systems. It emphasizes:

- **Governance**: Establishing policies and procedures for AI deployment.
- **Assessment**: Regularly evaluating AI systems for vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation**: Implementing strategies to reduce identified risks.

### OWASP Top 10 for LLMs

The OWASP Foundation offers a list of the top ten vulnerabilities specific to large language models. This framework helps developers and security teams identify and address common pitfalls, such as:

- **Data Poisoning**: Ensuring training data is clean and reliable.
- **Model Inversion**: Protecting sensitive data from being extracted through model queries.

### MITRE ATLAS

The MITRE ATT&CK framework for AI, known as MITRE ATLAS, provides a structured approach to understanding AI threats. It categorizes techniques and tactics used by adversaries to exploit AI systems, helping organizations prepare and defend against potential attacks.

## Real-World Case Studies

To illustrate the concepts discussed in this repository, we present several real-world case studies. These examples highlight both successful implementations of AI in cybersecurity and cautionary tales of AI misuse.

### Case Study 1: AI-Driven Threat Detection

A major financial institution implemented an AI-driven threat detection system. By analyzing patterns in network traffic, the system identified anomalies that human analysts might overlook. The result was a significant reduction in response time to potential threats.

### Case Study 2: Data Poisoning Attack

In another scenario, a tech company faced a data poisoning attack that compromised its AI model. Adversaries manipulated the training data, leading to inaccurate predictions. This incident underscores the importance of data integrity in AI systems.

### Case Study 3: Prompt Injection Exploit

A chatbot used for customer service was exploited through prompt injection. Attackers manipulated user inputs to extract sensitive information. This case highlights the need for robust input validation in AI applications.
